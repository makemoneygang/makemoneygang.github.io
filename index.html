                    <p> Make Money Gang is for-profit organization founded by
                    CEO Nigel Lin who banded together several broke high school students
                    who play League of Legends and watch Japanese cartoons on the daily.

                    <p> At first glance, many would expect our primary mission to be to 
                        make money. However, contrary to our namesake, the ultimate goal
                        here at Make Money Gang is to obtain validation from women.
                        In other words, to "get bitches".
